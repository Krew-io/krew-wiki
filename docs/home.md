# Welcome to the Krew.io Wiki
Krew.io is a unique third person shooter style game that can be played [here](https://krew.io).


# What is Krew.io?
Krew.io is a multiplayer 3D third-person shooter web-based game, with an overall pirate theme, where players compete to sink each other, race for loot, and attempt to be a successful pirate. Included within the io games category, but vastly different to most .io games, it is mostly competitive, as players battle each other for #1, but is also somewhat cooperative, as players on the same ship will have to work together to sink enemies.

## Objective
As with most games of this genre, the main goal is to become #1 on the leaderboard. In order to do that, you can either search for crabs and shells on the [islands](/pages/islands.md), or kill other players to gain money and buy better [ships](/pages/ships.md).

But you can't do it alone. You will need a krew to provide extra firepower. You can use the trader boats to trade lots of goods to gain gold quickly, but will be an easy target and will need a full krew or fleet to protect you.
