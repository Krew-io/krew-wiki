# Upgrades

In Krew.io, there are 3 main upgrades you can add skill points, which are earned by gaining XP from farming crabs and shells, fishing, or killing other players and [Ships](/pages/ships.md).

The 3 upgrades to choose from are Fire Rate, Distance, and Damage, which you can either upgrade by hitting the red triangles above the stats, or by pressing `5`, `6`, or `7`.

## Fire Rate
This upgrades the reload speed of your cannon. 

Pressing `5` upgrades Fire Rate by 1 point.

---
## Distance 
This upgrades the distance of your cannon.

Pressing `6` upgrades Distance by 1 point.

---
## Damage 
This upgrades the damage of your cannon.

Pressing `7` upgrades Damage by 1 point.

## Things to note

### A few important things to note:

- Your level is capped at 50.
- Once the point is chosen between the 3 upgrades, it cannot be changed.

### Strategical facts to note:

- A maxed out damage stat amounts to only about 3 extra damage per shot.
- Just the right amount of distance can provide long-range benefits.
- A large fire rate works perfectly in accordance with the [Demolisher](/items/cannon/demolisher.md)
